This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/aminb/OneDrive/Documents/Data Science/Kaggle/Titanic/Submission")
```

```{r}
train <- read.csv("C:/Users/aminb/OneDrive/Documents/Data Science/Kaggle/Titanic/data/train.csv")

```

```{r}
summary(train$Sex)

```
```{r}
prop.table(table(train$Sex, train$Survived))
``` 
```{r}
prop.table(table(train$Sex, train$Survived)) * 100
```
```{r}
prop.table(table(train$Sex, train$Survived), 1) *100
```
```{r}
barplot(table(train$Sex), xlab = "Passsenger", ylab = "People",
        main = " Passenger")
```
```{r}
test <- read.csv("C:/Users/aminb/OneDrive/Documents/Data Science/Kaggle/Titanic/data/test.csv")

```

```{r}
test$Survived <- 0
```

```{r}
test$Survived [test["Sex"] == "female"] <- 1
```

```{r}
Sex_prediction <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = test$Survived)

write.csv(Sex_prediction, file = "sex_prediction.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
