This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/aminb/OneDrive/Documents/Data Science/Kaggle/Titanic/Submission")
```

```{r}
train <- read.csv("C:/Users/aminb/OneDrive/Documents/Data Science/Kaggle/Titanic/data/train.csv")

```

```{r}
test <- read.csv("C:/Users/aminb/OneDrive/Documents/Data Science/Kaggle/Titanic/data/test.csv")

```
 
```{r}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(rattle)
library(RColorBrewer)
```
```{r}
tree_demo <- rpart(Survived ~ Sex, data = train, method = "class")
fancyRpartPlot(tree_demo)
```


```{r}
round(prop.table(table(train$Survived)),2)


```

```{r}
round(prop.table(table(train$Sex, train$Survived),margin = 1),2)

```

```{r}
mytree2 <- rpart(Survived ~ Pclass + Age, data=train, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(mytree2)

```

```{r}
predict_tree <- rpart(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex +Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked, data = train, method = "class")

fancyRpartPlot(predict_tree)
```

```{r}
predict_by_tree <- predict(predict_tree, test, type = "class")
```

```{r}
predictionTree <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = predict_by_tree)
```

```{r}
write.csv(predictionTree, file = "tree.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
